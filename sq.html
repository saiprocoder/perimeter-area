          <h1>Square</h1>
          <p>Square is a quadrilateral which has 4 sides and 4 vertices. It's all sides are equal.</p>
          <br>
        <div class="t2">
          <h1>Square's Perimeter</h1>
          <p>As you all know that all the sides in a square are equal. So perimeter of a square = side + side + side + side. But you all know that repeated addition is multiplication. So, perimeter of a square is = 4 × side.</p>
          <br>
        <div class="t3">
          <h1>Square's Area</h1>
          <p>The Square's area is the area covered by it. The formula of finding a square's area = side × side.</p>
